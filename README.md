# THERIDDLERCHAT

THERIDDLERCHAT is a chat application inspired by the interface used in the movie "The Batman (2022)" In the movie, the antagonist, The Riddler, communicates with Batman through a chat and provides him with clues about his next victim.

When I first watched the movie, I found the idea intriguing and decided to create a similar web application. At that time, I lacked the necessary knowledge to develop the frontend, backend, and deploy applications. However, I kept the idea in the back of my mind until I acquired the required skills in frontend and backend development. Now that the initial version is completed, I can reflect on the learning journey and feel satisfied with the results.

The application is currently deployed at: https://riddlerchat.onrender.com/
